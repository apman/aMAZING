# aMAZING
An interactive marble maze to be operated by physical movement of player(s) using **Microsoft Kinect**.

This little demo was written in the open source programming language _Processing_, which is built on top of the Java. I wrote it as a first year Computer Science project in 2017.

At that time I was a DevDegree student at Shopify, and as luck would have it, Prince Charles took an interest in innovative educational programs, visited us at Shopify and volunteered to play!

## The game

The idea is to manipulate the maze by moving your body as if you were dancing _on_ the tray - moving your weight around in space would tilt the tray in the corresponding direction. Your goal is to 'collect' the golden rings by making the red ball travel to all the spots marked by a ring. (That's a bit less frustrating than the traditional task of avoiding wholes in the track).

|  ➡️<br />It could also be switched to function like a very primitive Foozball game | <img width="1112" alt="Screenshot_2_ball_isolated" src="https://github.com/apman/aMAZING/assets/1944636/f012b105-67ad-457d-829a-50bd1163e149"> |

<br />This screen recording (illustrating my selective wall-collision algorithm at work) gives you some idea of the game - crude but fun.

I also presented this project at the Ottawa Processing Days 2019.
